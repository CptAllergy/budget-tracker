    Budget Tracker is a web application that helps households track and split their expenses.
    <br />
    It allows you to add expenses, which will be split evenly amongst the members of the household.

## About The Project
Budget Tracker was created because I wanted to create a web application that would help me track my expenses and split them with in my household. Some other applications included annoying adds or required a subscription to access all features. I wanted to create a simple and free alternative for personal use.

### Tech Stack
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase

### UI 
I tried to style the application in a neo-brutalist style. The UI is inspired by the neo-brutalist UI libraries [neobrutalism.dev](https://www.neobrutalism.dev/) and [neo-ui](https://neo-brutalism-ui-library.vercel.app/).
